      <h3>What we do</h3>
      <hr>
      <h4>Mentorship</h4>
      <p>Our mentorship is simultaneously grounded in pragmatic, of-the-hour needs that will help you successfully navigate your high school years to make sure you don’t fall behind. In fact, with us by your side, you’ll get ahead of the pack. Way ahead. We’ll help you strategize the right courses and extracurricular activities. And we’ll take it a step further. Choosing extracurriculars is half the battle. Learning how to engage with each activity in a smart way is equally important, and more often than not, missed. We will teach you how to go after leadership opportunities and make lasting impressions on your teachers. By the time your college applications come into play, you will not only be ready, you’ll have a wealth of truly meaningful profile achievements and experiences to draw upon.</p>
      <h4>Curriculum planning</h4>
      <p>We work with students ranging from 6th graders to high school seniors. We help them navigate through the existing school curriculum to choose the best classes that will help prepare them to gain admission to highly selective colleges and universities. We also provide reading lists and other exercises that are customized to enhance the abilities of each student.</p>
      <h4>Test preparation and evaluation</h4>
      <p>We review all test scores including TOEFL, IELTS, SSAT, SATI, the three SATIIs, and ACT. In cases where test scores are substantially below the average of the college or university of their choice, we provide recommendations on how to improve their chances of admission. Most students applying to highly competitive colleges already know test scores are an important part of the decision process. However, not all perfect 800s get admitted. In these cases, we help the student communicate other parts of the application that I know from experience will be valued by admissions committees. The key is being to be able to communicate those attributes.</p>
      <h4>College application assistance</h4>
      <p>Meeting deadlines and other documentation requirements are critical. We help students manage each critical milestone in the application process to ensure that there are no last minutes glitches. Will Early Action or Regular Action applications enhance a student's chances of admission? How important is the Personal Statement? There is a enough variation among schools to warrant a closer look at each area.</p>
      <h4>Personal interview coaching</h4>
      <p>Most Ivy League colleges require an alumni interview as part of the admissions process. As an alumnus, we interview students each year on behalf of our colleges and write an extensive evaluation of each applicant. Naturally, we recuse ourselves if we have worked with the student. The alumni interview is a great opportunity for the student to communicate those attributes that they feel are most important for the admission committee to consider. We work with each student to ensure that the alumni interview makes a difference.</p>
      <h4>Application essay</h4>
      <p>The application essay should be given careful thought. Admissions officers are not looking for the right answer. You don't need to tell them what they want to hear, rather what you want us to hear. Your essay should help the committee understand who you are and what you think as an individual. Express yourself.</p>
